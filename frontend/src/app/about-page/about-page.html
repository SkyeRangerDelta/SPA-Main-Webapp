  <h3 class="content-header">Who we are</h3>
  <p>
    Founded in the bustling harbors of Port Sarim, the Sarim Port Authority began as a global trade conglomerate dedicated
    to mastering every facet of maritime logistics. From cargo inspection to fleet coordination, our mission has always
    been to keep the heart of commerce beating strong across the known world.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the lifeline for countless player-built cities, we oversee trade routes spanning oceans, deserts, and frozen
    tundras, ensuring goods flow safely and swiftly between continents. Our offices—strategically located in every
    major port—are staffed by seasoned dockmasters, shrewd merchants, and tireless customs officers, all working in
    harmony to keep the gears of civilization turning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, the Sarim Port Authority is more than a shipping magnate—it is a steward of safe harbors, trusted
    negotiations, and international cooperation. Whether you sail under our flag or simply pass through our ports, you
    can be certain that the world moves smoother when the SPA is at the helm.

  <h3 class="content-header">Who we really are</h3>
  <p>
    Outside the lore, the Sarim Port Authority is the collective title for the server’s moderation and administrative
    team. We’re the people behind the scenes keeping the Minecraft world running smoothly—managing player disputes,
    maintaining server stability, enforcing community guidelines, and ensuring that events and projects unfold without
    a hitch.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose the SPA identity not just as a fun roleplay element, but as a unifying banner that reflects how we work:
    facilitating connections, resolving conflicts, and keeping things moving in the right direction—much like a
    real-world port authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    While our “trade routes” may be block-built and our “cargo” purely digital, our commitment to creating a fair, fun,
    and immersive space for every player is very real. Think of us as both the harbor masters and the guardians of the
    realm—ready to help when the seas get rough.

  <h3 class="content-header">Where it all started</h3>
  <p>
    The Sarim Port Authority traces its origins to the Year of the Great Crossing, when the first fleets braved the
    uncharted seas to connect the isolated settlements of the Old World. At the time, the bustling harbor of Port Sarim
    was little more than a cluster of wooden piers and weather-beaten warehouses, serving as a gathering point for
    sailors, traders, and fortune-seekers.
  </p>
  <p>
    As trade flourished, disputes over docking rights, tariffs, and cargo claims became frequent. The chaos threatened
    to bring the young city to a standstill. In response, the Council of Sarim decreed the formation of a singular body
    to oversee all maritime affairs—granting it authority over shipping lanes, harbor security, and international trade
    law. Thus, the Sarim Port Authority was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    In its early years, the SPA focused solely on Sarim’s harbor, but its influence quickly spread. Merchant captains
    came to rely on its fair arbitration, and foreign ports adopted its regulations to streamline commerce. Within
    decades, the Authority had established offices across the known world including Olde Spawn and Satus City,
    transforming from a local harbor commission into the backbone of global trade.
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, the Sarim Port Authority stands as both a symbol of safe passage and the unseen force that keeps the world’s
    economies in motion—its influence reaching from the smallest fishing village to the grandest imperial capital.
