  <h4 class="content-subheader crit">In an Emergency Now?</h4>
  <p class="crit">
    STOP! If you are in immediate peril, raise signal to the nearest watch or harbour guard at once. The local
    SPA branch will be informed and assume control of the situation. If you are at sea, raise your emergency signal.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader">Concerning Emergencies</h4>
  <p>
    It is only natural that emergencies will arise from time to time. The Sarim Port Authority takes matters such as
    these with great sincerity and urgency. A safer harbour is a better harbour for all. The following document outlines
    simple procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. All emergencies are handled case-by-case via the SPA
    Office of Emergency Management. It should be imperative that you are familiar with the local SPA branch at each
    port you patron.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader att">Notify Local Authorities</h4>
  <p class="att">
    Notify the local emergency crews immediately such as the city watch, dock patrol, fire brigade, or other
    emergency services. The Sarim Port Authority will be made aware of the situation and will respond
    accordingly. It is important to provide as much information as possible about the emergency, including the
    location, nature of the emergency, and any injuries or damages sustained. This will help the OEM and port
    services to respond quickly and effectively.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader"><u>Section A - Shipboard Affairs</u></h4>
  <h5>Obligation to Rescue</h5>
  <p>
    In the event of a nearby sinking or capsizing vessels, all vessels in alignment with the Sarim Port Authority are
    obligated by maritime law (and goodwill) to assert their best effort and spare no expense to rescue castaways,
    search for survivors, and harbor said castaways to the nearest SPA-aligned port, regardless of the downed vessel's
    alignment. The SPA will compensate and award merit to those who aid in such efforts, and will in turn provide
    refunds for any losses, damages, or other financial gains which were forfeited in said rescue effort.
  </p>

  <h5>Reporting Maritime Incidents</h5>
  <p>
    Any collision, grounding, foundering, or other misadventure upon the water must be declared to the nearest SPA
    harbour office or officer without delay. The master shall give full account, naming the vessels, cargoes, crew
    complements, and injuries involved, along with the manner and place of the incident. Failure to render such account
    is subject to censure, fine, or forfeiture of harbour privileges.
  </p>

  <h5>Securing the Vessel</h5>
  <p>
    Lash down loose goods, secure hatches, and set anchors or moorings to prevent drift. Where hostile intent or
    misrule threatens, arm the crew and bar the gangway. Safeguard chests, maps, and cargo manifests from loss or
    theft until an SPA appointed inspector or adjudicator arrives.
  </p>

  <h5>Signaling for Militia & Naval Assistance</h5>
  <p>
    In times of grave peril from pirates, enemy craft, or unruly fleets, masters are to raise the red pennant, sound
    three long peals upon the ship’s bell, or light a beacon if within sight of shore. When far at sea, signal fires,
    coloured banners, or messenger craft may be employed. The SPA shall dispatch the harbour militia or petition naval
    escort from the fleet when warranted.
  </p>

  <h5>Onboard Explosions</h5>
  <p>
    Should powder, cannon, boiler, or other volatile cargo erupt, the master shall at once order the fire-fighting
    party to smother the blaze with sand, water, gravel, or other materials on hand. Injured crew are to be removed
    from danger, and remaining powder stores secured or cast overboard if the ship’s safety demands. Surviving logs,
    manifests, and cargo lists are to be preserved for SPA inquiry.
  </p>

  <h5>Drifting and Runaway Hazards</h5>
  <p>
    A vessel unmoored and adrift is a hazard to all. Any ship sighting such danger shall signal at once and, if able,
    dispatch a launch to secure towlines or scuttle the drifting craft if no salvage is possible. In frozen climes or
    high seas, where approach is unwise, mark the hazard by buoy or beacon so that others may steer clear.
  </p>

  <h5>Navigational Mishaps</h5>
  <p>
    Groundings, shoal strikes, and collisions are to be met first with care for crew and passengers, then with measures
    to lighten the ship or warp her off the hazard. Where the channel is obstructed, signal passing craft to heave-to
    until cleared. Charts and compass records from the day’s sailing are to be presented to SPA officials for review. If
    lightening the ship is deemed unfeasible, the master should signal for assistance from the nearest SPA port or naval
    for dredging or towing.
  </p>

  <h5>Mutiny</h5>
  <p>
    Where a crew rises against their lawful master, the master or loyal officers shall secure themselves in the most
    defensible part of the vessel, send distress signals toward the nearest friendly port, and, if possible, scuttle
    the helm or sails to prevent hostile control of the ship. Upon arrival of SPA or naval forces, mutineers are to be
    surrendered in full. An SPA adjudicator will be dispatched to determine the cause of the mutiny and journal a
    report to be used in a formal trial.
  </p>

  <h5>Disorderly Crew</h5>
  <p>
    Fights, drunkenness, and insubordination are to be quelled by the ship’s officers, with the ringleaders confined to
    quarters or the brig until the next port. Masters are obliged to log such events and submit the record to the
    harbour office for judgment.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader"><u>Section B - Port Affairs</u></h4>
  <h5>Dockside & Warehouse Fires</h5>
  <p>
    Should flame break out upon the wharves or in any bonded warehouse, raise the alarm by bell, horn, or beacon fire.
    All able hands within sight are to form bucket lines from the nearest cistern or seawater source. Remove powder, oil,
    Redstone, or other volatile cargo at once to a safe distance. SPA or port fire brigades shall assume command upon
    arrival; masters interfering with their orders shall be fined.
  </p>

  <h5>Hazardous Cargo Spills</h5>
  <p>
    When cargo of dangerous nature—gunpowder, TNT, blaze powder, or other combustibles—be spilled or ruptured, clear
    the area of idle folk and close all nearby lanterns and braziers. Contain the substance in barrels, wool, or sand as
    the cargo warrants. SPA inspectors must be summoned forthwith to direct disposal or salvage.
  </p>

  <h5>Civil Unrest & Piracy</h5>
  <p>
    In the event of riot, mob, or pirate incursion within the harbour bounds, withdraw non-combatants to the nearest
    secure warehouse, guardhouse, or defensible locale. Close dock gates and raise the black-and-yellow warning flag.
    The SPA harbour militia or local guard will be mustered, and, if required, naval aid from the fleet will be
    requested. Masters may be called to lend crew to the defence under SPA regulation.
  </p>

  <h5>Harbour Blockages</h5>
  <p>
    A vessel sunk or grounded in the main channel is to be reported by swiftest means. Tenders and barges shall be
    dispatched to mark the obstruction with buoys and signal flags. Cargo and ballast may be offloaded to lighten the
    hull for refloating; in extremis, the SPA may order the wreck dismantled to clear passage for trade. Compensation
    will be determined according to salvage law.
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning blockages caused by navigational mishaps with another vessel, the master of the offending ship is to
    render full account to the SPA and assist in clearing the channel. If the vessel is beyond salvage, the master
    shall forfeit harbour privileges until the obstruction is cleared and any damages compensated.
  </p>

  <h5>Powder Magazine Incidents</h5>
  <p>
    Any smoke, spark, or flame within sight or scent of the harbour’s powder magazine is to be treated as dire alarm.
    All hands are to withdraw to the safe line as posted, while dock crews and patrols investigate. Where explosion has
    occurred, secure the perimeter against looters and collect surviving powder kegs for transport to a safe magazine.
    Debris from such blasts is SPA property until released by the SPA.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader"><u>Section C - Medical Emergencies</u></h4>
  <h5>Mass Casualty Events</h5>
  <p>
    When great numbers be stricken—whether by wreck, battle, fire, or other calamity—the nearest SPA officers (captain
    or master) shall take command of the area to direct triage. Separate the injured into those fit to walk, those
    needing aid, and those beyond help. Clear space upon the docks or in a warehouse for the treatment of survivors.
    Ships with spare berths may be ordered to serve as hospital hulks until proper lodgings ashore are prepared.
  </p>

  <h5>Sick Bay Availability & Surgeon Access</h5>
  <p>
    The SPA maintains surgeons and chirurgeons at all ports. In emergencies, dispatch a runner to the infirmary or sound
    three short peals upon the dock bell. A surgeon will be sent aboard or ashore as the case demands. In the absence of
    SPA staff, the master may conscript any local healer or cleric, the fee to be repaid by the SPA. Masters or other
    qualified persons may requisition healing and regeneration potions from the SPA for use in emergencies.
  </p>

  <h5>Quarantine & Contagion Protocols</h5>
  <p>
    Should illness of suspicious nature present itself aboard a vessel, hoist the yellow flag at the mainmast before
    making port. Port medical officers shall board to examine crew and cargo. If contagion be confirmed, the ship shall
    be anchored in port quarantine zones or well offshore for such time as the SPA decrees. Suspect cargo—spoiled
    foodstuffs, pufferfish, rotten flesh—is to be burned or buried well clear of settlement walls.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader"><u>Section D - Natural Disasters</u></h4>
  <h5>Storm Surge & Hurricane Procedures</h5>
  <p>
    When darkening skies and suspicion of gale, the harbour master shall order all vessels to double moorings and
    strike topmasts. Loose canvas is to be furled, deck cargo stowed, and all hatches battened. Ships at sea are to run
    for the nearest safe anchorage or weather the storm in open water if the harbour mouth be unsafe. Beacon fires
    should be lit before nightfall to guide any ship caught in the squall.
  </p>
  <p>
    When high tides are driven upon the coast by wind or tempest, dock crews are to clear the lower warehouses of goods
    and move them to upper floors. Wharf planking may be dismantled to prevent its destruction and loss. Dock crews will
    direct sandbagging and barricades at critical points. Any vessel within the harbour is to keep steam or sail ready
    for quick departure should moorings fail.
  </p>

  <h5>Earthquake & Tsunami Response</h5>
  <p>
    Upon any sudden trembling of the earth, masters are to clear the decks and secure rigging against falling spars. If
    the sea withdraws unnaturally from the shore, all hands are to retreat inland to muster points upon higher ground.
    Harbour gates shall be shut, and vessels in deep water warned to remain at sea until the all-clear is given. The
    SPA will dispatch surveyors to sound the harbour for shoaling or new hazards before trade resumes.
  </p>

  <h5>Evacuation & Muster Points</h5>
  <p>
    In the event a port must be abandoned—by flood, fire, siege, or other calamity—the SPA shall post the muster points
    in the public notice square. From these points, escorted routes will lead to safe camps outside the hazard zone.
    Muster points are marked with coloured banners and lanterns for quick recognition.
  </p>

  <h5>Icebound Harbour Response</h5>
  <p>
    Where sea-ice closes the harbour, ships shall be warped into protected basins or hauled onto the slipway to avoid
    damage from crushing. The SPA will organise ice-cutting crews to open a channel for vital trade and mail packets.
    Masters are cautioned not to attempt passage without escort, as shifting floes may trap a vessel beyond aid.
    Icebreaker galleys fitted with reinforced bows may be employed. Those with frostwalker enchantments are to be
    prohibited from entering the harbour until the ice has cleared.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader"><u>Section E - Communication & Reporting</u></h4>
  <h5>Signaling for Help</h5>
  <p>
    When distress arises, signals must be plain and unmistakable. In daylight, raise the red pennant or wave bright
    cloths from the quarterdeck. At night, display three lanterns in a vertical line or fire two rockets in quick
    succession. Ashore, strike the dock bell in long, deliberate peals, or light a beacon visible from the water.
    Coloured banners or beacon beams may be employed to summon SPA aid.
  </p>

  <h5>Documentation & Incident Logging</h5>
  <p>
    Every master is bound to keep a true and complete account of any mishap, hazard, or disorder aboard or ashore
    involving their vessel. This log must record the date, hour, location, weather, tide, cause, and all persons or
    cargo affected. Upon arrival in port, the record is to be submitted at the SPA harbour office, where clerks will
    copy it into the Port Register. Falsifying or omitting such accounts is grounds for fine, seizure of goods, or
    forfeiture of charter.
  </p>

  <h5>Dispatching Riders & Packet Boats</h5>
  <p>
    When harbour signals cannot reach the necessary authority, dispatch must be made by rider or packet boat without
    delay. Riders shall bear sealed letters bearing the SPA Seal, and packet boats shall be provisioned for speed over
    comfort. Suitable tamed mounts or nether portal relays may be employed to hasten communication across great distance.
    The bearer of such dispatches is to be given right-of-way and protection at all costs.
  </p>

  <h4 class="content-subheader"><u>Section F - Supplemental Emergency Clauses</u></h4>
  <h5>Non-discrimination in Rescue & Aid</h5>
  <p>
    No master or crew under SPA registry shall withhold rescue, succour, or safe conduct on account of flag, allegiance,
    creed, trade, or past rivalry. Aid rendered to vessels or persons in peril shall be given freely, save only in
    cases where hostile arms are borne against the rescuer. Breach of this clause invites censure, loss of charter, or
    seizure of vessel by SPA authority.
  </p>
  <p>
    Exceptions to this clause include those who are actively engaged in piracy, smuggling, or other illegal activities
    including whitelist evasion. Those fitting this clause will be reported to the SPA and may face legal action or
    penalties as deemed appropriate by the SPA including nether fortress or end imprisonment, server timeouts, or even
    permanent bans.
  </p>

  <h5>Duty of Care for Patrons and Crew</h5>
  <p>
    Masters and officers are bound to provide reasonable protection to all aboard—be they crew, passenger, or paying
    patron—from foreseeable harm whilst under their charge. This duty extends to the safeguarding of cargo, manifests,
    and any entrusted property, including goods held in chests or storehouses. Neglect of this duty shall be weighed
    heavily in any SPA tribunal.
  </p>

  <h5>Rewards and Penalties for Compliance/Negligence</h5>
  <p>
    Those who conduct themselves with valour and fidelity in times of peril may be awarded letters of commendation,
    monetary bounty, or trade privileges within SPA ports. Conversely, those found negligent, cowardly, or wilfully
    obstructive in emergencies shall be fined, stripped of licences, or barred from harbour for no less than one year.
    Penalties may be levied in coin, goods, or blocks of proven value.
  </p>

  <h5>Emergency Chain of Command</h5>
  <p>
    In the absence of the master, command falls in order to the first mate, second mate, boatswain, or such officer as
    the SPA may appoint on scene. Once SPA officers or naval commanders arrive, all vessels and crews present shall
    answer to their orders until the emergency is declared resolved. Disobedience in such moments is treated as mutiny
    under SPA law.
  </p>

  <h5>Authority to Board</h5>
  <p>
    The SPA reserves the right to board any vessel—afloat, adrift, or at berth—when an emergency threatens life, cargo,
    or the peace of the harbour. Such boarding may be effected with or without the master’s consent, and crew shall
    offer full cooperation. Refusal grants the SPA power to seize the vessel and detain all persons aboard for inquiry.
  </p>

  <h5>Safe Harbour Provision</h5>
  <p>
    In time of war, storm, famine, or calamity, any vessel seeking refuge in an SPA port shall be granted temporary
    mooring and aid, regardless of nation or faction, provided they submit to the laws of the harbour and cause no
    disturbance. Such sanctuary shall last until the hazard has passed or the SPA orders departure.
