  <p>
    It is only natural that emergencies will arise from time to time. The Sarim Port Authority takes matters such as
    these with great sincerity and urgency. A safer harbour is a better harbour for all. The following document outlines
    simple procedures to follow in the event of an emergency. All emergencies are handled case-by-case via the SPA
    Office of Emergency Management. It should be imperative that you are familiar with the local SPA branch at each
    port you patron.
